# Strategy Dashboard

A React-based dashboard to visualize option trading strategies based on
market view (Bullish, Bearish, RangeBound, Volatile) and selected dates.

The application renders strategy cards dynamically, aggregates strategy
occurrences, and handles empty states gracefully — built using plain
React with no external UI libraries.

## Features

- View toggle (Bullish, Bearish, RangeBound, Volatile)
- Date dropdown rendered from static data
- Dynamic strategy cards based on selected date
- Aggregated strategy count with singular/plural handling
- Graceful empty-state rendering
- Clean and scalable folder structure

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (no UI libraries)

## Project Goal

To demonstrate clean component architecture, state management,
data transformation, and UI rendering logic using core React concepts.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
